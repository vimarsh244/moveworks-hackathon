On behalf of our entire team, I’m excited to share that Moveworks has landed in Europe! 

We’re hiring aggressively for go-to-market roles in the UK, France, and Germany, where we’ll open new offices this year. Already, European companies across industries rely on Moveworks to deliver a world-class employee experience, and we’re only getting started.

I’d like to thank the thousands of leaders in North America who believe in our vision — leaders who refuse to settle for the status quo when it comes to truly supporting their people. Our customers at companies like Palo Alto Networks, DocuSign, and Verisk decided that getting help at work should take seconds, and so they invested in a conversational AI platform that often wasn’t in the business plan, because they knew it would solve a huge business problem. They made this milestone a reality.

The truth is that employee experience will make or break every business in Europe, since flexible work opens up job opportunities anywhere on Earth. Now, you can simply log out of your current company and log in to another, which means you won’t tolerate waiting three days to get IT support, or having no idea where to go for HR help, or enrolling in the wrong healthcare policy because you missed a mass email. Moveworks is ready to meet the demand for our platform in Europe, and enable customers like Premier Foods to meet employees’ expectations:

 

"Our employees expect a seamless experience, which is why we're thrilled to be on this journey with Moveworks. We look forward to giving our colleagues immediate support in Microsoft Teams, where they already spend their digital day, just by asking the Moveworks bot. This is the heart of our Productivity & Collaboration strategy: transforming the Teams experience with AI."

—  Gareth Byrne-Perkins, Director of Technology, Security, & Services, Premier Foods

 

Over the last two years, we’ve seen remote and hybrid teams turn to conversational AI chatbots to stay productive, whether they need IT support, HR service, or a colleague’s phone number. Wherever they are, they can describe their request to their Moveworks bot, which provides the most relevant solution available at the company right away. Critically, Moveworks offers multilingual support in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, making instant help available throughout Western Europe. 

At a time when 89% of UK organizations provide the option of flexible work, AI platforms are a necessity to fulfill that promise. Moveworks lets companies support their employees 24/7, across every time zone, so they can focus on what matters. 

It’s also my pleasure to announce that Moveworks has added two renowned executives as GTM leaders in Europe: our Chief Revenue Officer Marcello Gallo and our Vice President of EMEA Marc Zakher. Marcello and Marc help each account executive master a customer engagement model that’s proven to close deals with Fortune 500 customers, so they can earn their PhD in enterprise sales.

If you’re looking to join a world-changing AI company with career-defining growth opportunities, I’d have to recommend Moveworks.
