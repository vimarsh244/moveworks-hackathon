Bhavin Shah, CEO and Founder


At Moveworks, we believe that values should shape actions. 

Successful companies recognize that values are not just inspirational platitudes but clear guidelines that direct how an organization operates and serves its stakeholders.

That’s why our mission is to make language the universal UI. We’ve worked diligently to craft a conversational interface that works across systems powered by large language models (LLMs). It is this foundation that enables our technology innovation and company growth. And it is also this foundation that leads our customers like Hearst, Broadcom, and Palo Alto Networks to trust and value both our out-of-the-box solutions and developer tools to bring conversational automation to all business functions. 

Our values are what guide us, which is why we are honored to be named to the Forbes 2023 Cloud 100 list, which spotlights companies that pair strong values with top performance. 

The Cloud 100 is a prestigious annual list of the world's top 100 private cloud companies — produced by Forbes in partnership with Bessemer Venture Partners and Salesforce Ventures. It recognizes standout companies in the cloud technology sector ranging from small startups to major private-equity-backed organizations, such as Stripe, Figma, Databricks, and a long list of other groundbreaking companies. The five key values that make this award so important are: Teamwork, Transparency & Honesty, Putting the Customer First, Ownership, Ambition & Boldness.

This award and the values it promotes affirm that the world now knows what’s possible with conversational AI. We’ve all seen its latest advancements accomplishing tasks unimaginable when we launched Moveworks seven years ago. Today, every business leader is now looking to inject conversational AI into their enterprise.



Before the recent AI boom, when many were still unaware of the potential for conversational AI in business, Moveworks was trailblazing and developing enterprise solutions as far back as 2016. 

We started by using natural language understanding (NLU) to automate IT support tasks with zero maintenance required. But today, our platform goes beyond support to connect employees to every enterprise system through an AI-powered conversational interface. 

We’ve focused on making conversational AI seamlessly accessible across the enterprise with an out-of-the-box enterprise copilot that integrates with hundreds of applications, engages in more than one hundred languages, and leverages a stack of specialized large language models to give employees a single intelligent assistant to get work done, instead of navigating complex apps.

As a result, we’ve received notable recognition, not only in this year’s Cloud 100 list but also in the Forbes AI 50 five years running and in the AI Breakthrough Awards for best natural language generation platform.

However, awards reflect outcomes, not how results are achieved.

While we've received recognition for our innovative AI platform, we are most proud of our industry-leading conversational AI technology, the real-world results we deliver for customers, and our team that makes it all happen.

 

What sets Moveworks apart is our long-term focus on scalable, secure, and ethical integration of AI across the enterprise. We invest deeply in data privacy, security, and responsible AI practices. This includes leveraging data centers in the EU and Canada and robust model testing and evaluation. 

On the technical side, our accumulated domain- and task-specific data, unique insight into our customers’ needs, and ever-maturing MLOps system and teams feed into our success. To get here, we’ve invested in both headcount and technology. Our annotators, machine learning engineers, data scientists, and more work together to bring real AI to the enterprise. 

With Moveworks’ expert team, you get access to best-in-class models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4 for search relevance, Google’s BERT for intent classification, and Meta’s RoBERTa for entity recognition.

You get models fine-tuned and grounded with over 500 million support tickets, over 10 billion bot conversations, and more than 100 million enterprise resources to ensure the language models understand the language of work. And you get a solution that provides users precisely what they need when they need it. 

We aim to provide the most effective enterprise AI platform through an approach rooted in our values. We’ve upheld this commitment for over seven years of technology innovation and will continue to exemplify what it takes to be at the forefront of this growing industry disrupter. As conversational AI goes mainstream, we are proud to remain leaders doing it the right way — enabling employees with an AI assistant they can trust.

 

Rapid advances in LLMs and NLU, culminating in the release of ChatGPT, have brought conversational AI to the forefront of society. And as a result, enterprises face a business imperative: incorporate conversational AI into their tech stacks. 

The thing is that we believe AI doesn’t have to be ungainly, esoteric, and brutal to work with — that’s why Moveworks makes building with advanced, optimized conversational AI technology easy. 

Here’s how we help our customers adopt this technology as effectively as possible.

Moveworks makes advanced conversational AI easily accessible for any enterprise use case. Our platform layers intelligent conversational interfaces on top of existing systems — no ripping and replacing required. This allows enterprises to incorporate AI at their own pace and empowers various functions across IT, HR and more to build tailored AI experiences without complex coding required.

We remain at the forefront of AI investment to fuel our customers’ continued success. And we intend to continue focusing resources on advancing conversational AI for the enterprise.

But more than providing access to cutting-edge technology, Moveworks puts customers first. Our conversational AI solutions start and end with enabling every team to work smarter and be more productive. We handle the complex AI so you can focus on results. Moveworks strives to be the easiest, most effective way to make conversational AI work for the enterprise.

At Moveworks, employees are the heart and soul of the company. We believe that fostering a culture of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging is not just good for its employees, it’s good for business. In short — we believe our employees are our most valuable assets.

As a global company with teams spread across Europe, India, Canada, Australia, and the United States, we provide the tools and flexibility for employees to thrive anywhere. We also drink our own champagne — leveraging Moveworks' AI platform internally to assist our teams.

We cherish our inclusive, equitable culture where everyone belongs. A majority of leadership roles are held by people with diverse backgrounds. Plus, we build in practices to reduce bias in hiring, compensation, and beyond.

We care about enabling each person to grow through benefits, learning opportunities, and employee resource groups like Women In Sales and Working Parents. Employees take risks, stretch their skills, and lift each other up.

Our employees drive our success. Moveworks is committed to creating an environment where every person can thrive and reach their full potential. When our people grow, we all rise.

 

Conversational AI is now a business imperative with the category poised for massive growth. As the market expands, Moveworks is proud to remain an industry leader in advancing enterprise adoption.

Our inclusion in the prestigious Cloud 100 affirms our impact. But more importantly, it's our long-term commitment to responsible, scalable AI that enables our success.

We lead in research and development to push boundaries. And we put users first — guiding partners and customers to create AI that solves real business challenges, allowing companies to unlock productivity and create magical experiences for employees and customers alike.

As conversational AI continues on its upward trajectory, we are similarly just getting started. We presented some of what we’re working on at Moveworks Live and know the future is full of potential, and Moveworks is ready to realize it the right way.
